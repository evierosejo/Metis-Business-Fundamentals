# Determining Location of Greatest Impact 

The goal of this project is determine locations in the United States that are experiencing the greatest amount of chronic homelessness and climatatic vulnerability to identify where Austin nonprofit, Mobile Loaves and Fishes (MLF) should expand their developments of 3D printed homes to have the largest impact. 

To begin identifying locations with the greatest need, I first looked at severe weather event data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to identify states most affected by severe weather.

I also looked at the highest costs of property damage by state in 2020.

Based upon this exploratory analysis, I would recommend MLF to continue their work in Texas, or expand their operations into Tennessee.
