# Problem
Austin, TX nonprofit, Mobile Loaves and Fishes (MLF), has just finished the country's first master planned development, 
Community First! Village, providing affordable, permanent housing to an estimated 480 individuals who have formerly suffered chronic homelessness, approximately 40% of Austin's chronically homeless population. ICON, a construction technologies company out of Austin, 3D printed a 500 sq ft 'Welcome Center', which was built in under 27 hours across several days, and six microhomes for the Village. Seeing the success of ICON's approach to construction, Alan Graham, CEO of MLF, wants to expand their partnership with ICON by creating a totally 3D printed development in a location that is experiencing the greatest amount of chronic homelessness and climatic vulnerability, since the 3D printed homes are made of reinforced concrete, which is mold- and fire-resistant and ideal for earthquakes and high-force winds. By targeting an area affected by natural disasters with a significant amount of individuals suffering from chronic homelessness, MLF can expand into new geographies and build their new development in a place that will have the largest impact on homelessness alleviation. 

# Data
* [Severe Storms and Extreme Events data](https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/severe-storms-and-extreme-events-data-table) for 2020, acquired via NOAA, Climate.gov 
* [Point-in-Time (PIT) and Housing Inventory Count (HIC) data](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/) for 2020 from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Exchange

I expect to be working with features related to wildfires, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, extreme wind, hurricanes, and homelessness. If possible, I would like to acquire additional economic data on state government grants for housing development as a feature to determine the financial feasibility of development at a praticular location. 

# Tools
1. Excel to conduct EDA - I expect to be conducting EDA in Excel since I will be working with a fairly large dataset and to gain familiarity with Excel specific commands.
2. Tableau to visualize data 

# MVP
A Minimum Viable Product for this project could be a simple visualization in Excel, e.g., a scatter plot showing the relationship between severe weather events and homelessness.
